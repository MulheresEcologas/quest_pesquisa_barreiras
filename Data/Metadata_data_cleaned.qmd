## Data collection

The online survey was approved by the human research ethics committee of the Federal University of Bahia (CEpEE/UFBA) under the Certificate of Presentation for Ethical Assessment (CAAE) 69100023.3.0000.5531. The questionnaire was divided into seven sections comprising 45 objective questions and three descriptive questions, regarding personal information, domestic labor and career, education and income, work environment, guidance and productivity, parenthood, and, academic career satisfaction.

The full questionnaire can be access [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mCdxmBDXIof6uf-SFflDfcGB828JWkIm/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107687295963966370443&rtpof=true&sd=true).

The online survey was avaiable from june to october 2023. A total of 399 respondents answered the online survey. Answers were filtered first by gender, as we had few respondents who didn’t identify themselves as women and men, by country of birth (we only considered answers of respondents who were born and have worked in Brazil) and by occupation, as our goal is to see respondent's perception in scientific institutions we only considered answers of those who were currently at the academy. Our final dataset encompasses 283 answers, of which 69 were self-identified as men and 215 as women - "data_cleaned.csv".
